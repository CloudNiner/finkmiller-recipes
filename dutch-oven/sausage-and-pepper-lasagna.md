# Sausage and Pepper Lasagna

_Serves:_ **4 - 6** | _Total time:_ **1 hour**

## Ingredients

* [ ] **2 tbsp** olive oil
* [ ] **1 lb** bulk italian sausage
* [ ] **1/4 cup** grated carrot
* [ ] **1/2 cup** diced onion
* [ ] **1** diced red pepper
* [ ] **1** minced garlic clove
* [ ] **3/4 tsp** kosher salt
* [ ] **1/4 tsp** fresh black pepper
* [ ] **1 28oz can** crushed tomatoes
* [ ] **3/4 cup** chicken stock
* [ ] **1/2 cup** whole milk ricotta cheese
* [ ] **1 1/2 cup** loose packed arugula leaves, torn
* [ ] **6** lasagna noodles, broken into 2 in pieces
* [ ] **1 1/2 cup** grated smoked gouda cheese

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400F.

Heat the oil over medium heat in a dutch oven, add the sausage and cook, breaking up with a spatula, until nicely browned. Spoon off all but 2 tbsp fat, then add the carrot, onion, pepper and garlic and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

Add tomatoes and chicken stock, bring to a simmer and stir to combine well. Remove from heat, then stir in ricotta and arugula leaves. Layer and submerge the lasagna noodle pieces into the sauce, pressing down on each layer and gently stirring to make sure they are covered.

Cover the top with grated cheese and bake uncovered for 15 minutes until cheese is bubbling and browned. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
