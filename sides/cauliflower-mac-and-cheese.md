# Cauliflower Mac and Cheese 

## Ingredients

* [ ] **1/2 tsp** kosher salt
* [ ] **1 large head** cauliflower
* [ ] **1 cup** heavy cream
* [ ] **2 oz** cream cheese
* [ ] **1 1/2 tsp** dijon mustard
* [ ] **1 1/2 cup** shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* [ ] **1/4 tsp** ground black pepper
* [ ] **1/8 tsp** garlic powder

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375F.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water with salt.

Spray the baking dish with vegetable oil spray. 

Cook the cauliflower in the boiling water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well and pat between several layers of paper towels to dry. Transfer the cauliflower to the baking dish and set aside.

Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan, and whisk in the cream cheese and mustard until smooth. Stir in 1 cup of the cheese, salt, pepper and garlic and whisk just until the cheese melts, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, pour over the cauliflower, and stir to combine. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese and bake until browned and bubbly hot, about 15 minutes. Serve.
