# Cornbread with Honey Butter

## Ingredients

### The Cornbread

* [ ] **400 g** unsalted butter
* [ ] **900 g** frozen corn
* [ ] **160 g** heavy cream
* [ ] **90 g** whole milk
* [ ] **3** large egg
* [ ] **245 g** bleached cake flour
* [ ] **230 g** isomalt
* [ ] **160 g** medium grind cornmeal
* [ ] **90 g** sugar
* [ ] **10 g** salt
* [ ] **4.5 g** baking powder
* [ ] **2.5 g** baking soda

### The Honey Butter

* [ ] **450 g** unsalted softened butter
* [ ] **4 g** salt
* [ ] **175 g** honey

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Melt butter on high heat in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add the corn, scraping the bottom of the pot continuously to prevent scorching. Cook until golden brown.

In a blender, blend corn-and-butter mixture. Add cream and milk. Blend on high until smooth. Add the eggs and continue blending until well mixed.

Dry blend remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Transfer corn purée to the bowl of dry ingredients
Use a rubber spatula to mix thoroughly.

Coat small bread pans or cast iron skillet with butter. Dust with flour. Remove excess flour by tapping each pan against the counter. Add batter to pans.

Bake to core temperature of 194 °F / 90 °C, about 15 minutes.

If using bread tins, carefully remove the bread from the pans while still hot, and place on cooling rack. This way, the bread will develop more of a crust.

## Instructions -- Honey Butter

Combine all ingredients in a stand mixer or food processor. Or use a Pacojet if available. You can whip the butter if you want a light, spreadable texture or simply mix until everything is combined to retain the dense texture of regular butter.
